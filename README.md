# Applesauce
Applesauce is a simple and lightweight Discord `python3` bot aimed at providing a highly customizable and modular architecture. Each feature for Applesauce is an independent addon (cog). This makes adding to and modifying Applesauce super easy.

### WARNING
* I suck at coding. I try my best but please don't get mad if you come across some crap code ðŸ˜•.
* Applesauce is currently in the very early stages of development. Lots of things are missing.

## Configuration
Applesauce is configured by copying your desired addon into the `cogs/addons` folder. **More information will be added once Applesauce is further developed.**

## Installation
Since Applesauce is coded fully in `python3`, installation is as simple as installing python3 and the requires libraries for each addon. **More information will be added once Applesauce is further developed.**
