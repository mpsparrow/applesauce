# Applesauce
Applesauce is a lightweight Discord bot aimed at providing a highly customizable and modular architecture. Each feature is an independent cog, which makes adding to and modifying things super easy. Applesauce is built using the popular [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

## Plan
I am currently working on finalizing the framework for Applesauce. Once the framework is more polished, I have a pile of useful features and commands that are lined up to be added. Who knows where this bot will go after that. My plan for now is probably to add a pile of documentation so that anyone can fork and use the already created framework that Applesauce provides to easily create their own powerful Discord bot.

## WARNING
I suck at coding. I try my best but please don't get mad if you come across some crap code ðŸ˜•. This is my first Discord bot so I am fairly noob at it....

### Development
- `master` somewhat tested beta version
- `dev` unstable nightly blind
