# Applesauce
Applesauce is a simple and lightweight Discord python bot aimed at providing a highly customizable and modular architecture. Each feature for Applesauce is an independent cog, which makes adding to and modifying Applesauce super easy.

### WARNING
* I suck at coding. I try my best but please don't get mad if you come across some crap code ðŸ˜•.
* Applesauce is still being actively worked on and improved. Lots of things are missing so please be patient.

### Development
- `master` somewhat tested beta version
- `dev` probably unstable nightly blind
