# Applesauce
Applesauce is a simple and lightweight Discord python bot aimed at providing a highly customizable and modular architecture. Each feature for Applesauce is an independent addon (cog). This makes adding to and modifying Applesauce super easy.

### Development
`master` is the most recent stable release (which isn't a think at this time)
`dev` is for development and testing

### WARNING
* I suck at coding. I try my best but please don't get mad if you come across some crap code ðŸ˜•.
* Applesauce is currently in the very early stages of development. Lots of things are missing.
