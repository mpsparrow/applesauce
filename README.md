Applesauce is a lightweight Discord bot framework aimed at providing a highly customizable and modular architecture. Each feature is an independent cog, which makes adding to and modifying things super easy. Applesauce is built using the popular [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.
