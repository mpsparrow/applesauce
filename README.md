# Applesauce
Applesauce is a simple and lightweight Discord `python3` bot aimed at providing a highly customizable and modular architecture. Each feature for Applesauce is an independent cog (plugin). This makes writing plugins for Applesauce easy and effortless.

## WARNING
I suck at coding. I try my best but please don't get mad if you come across some crap code ðŸ˜•. Applesauce is also currently in the very early stages of development. Lots of things are missing.

### Configuration
Applesauce is configured by copying your desired plugins into the `cogs` folder and then configuring those plugins through `config.ini`. **More information will be added once Applesauce is further developed.**

# Installation
Since Applesauce is coded fully in `python3`, installation is as simple as installing python3 and the requires libraries for each module. **More information will be added once Applesauce is further developed.**

### Modules/Plugins/Cogs
* **admin** (required): commands to reload and manage modules
* **api**: Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha lookup commands
* **basic**: random number, coin flip, and other simple commands
* **debug**: debug commands
* **error** (required): logs error messages
